Front end Angular application for theater-or-chill movie app. Still a work in progress but I am getting there. 

UPDATE - 2021-12-19: 
I have worked on some of the routes. There is a bit more work left to do and some issues to work on such as:
  - I need to get the movie posters in the carousels to be the same height. 
  - I need to get my date comparison code working. I've tried various things like using getTime() and converting to ISO format strings but nothing has worked so far. May explore third-party libraries.
  - I need to get rid of the whitespace below the footer.
  - I need to finish the cart, account, movie detail, about and contact us routes. I may add more routes later on, such as a checkout page.
  - Implement the search function.
  - Get movie posters to display evenly as the number of returned movies changes.
